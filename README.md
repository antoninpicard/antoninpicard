### Hi there 👋
My name is Antonin, and I have been a French programming student for a few years. I have been using GitHub to host my projects.

### About me 🌱
I'm a coding enthusiast and love learning about everything in general. I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, honing my skills, and learning from other developers.

When I'm not coding, you can find me immersed in books, cooking, or playing video games. You can learn more about my work and projects on my [Portfolio](http://antoninpicard.com). Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonin-picard-078a36360/).

😁 I hope you enjoy my profile and explore my projects.

Happy coding! 💻
